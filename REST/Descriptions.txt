This is the authorization header used by WS02 gateway to grant access to the API via an OAUTH token. It contains the Bearer Token obtained from Ping Identity system. For details on consuming APIs, see https://prod-1-confluence.mufgamericas.com/display/1AF/How+to+Consume+an+API
Also known as a Transit ID, this is a unique identifier value that is attached to requests and messages that allow reference to a particular transaction or event chain. This is at a session level, so if you wanted to see all the calls during a session, this ties them all together.
The X-MUFG-Access-Token is similar to the Authorization header, but is used as a secondary field to pass the back-end credentials to the API Gateway. The gateway will use the Authorization header to authorize the first leg of that communication before allowing the call to proceed. Then it will switch the X-MUFG-Access-Token value into the Authorization field before sending that request to the back-end server.
Request origination application GSI Id. Valid values in https://ebcm.unionbank.com/Archer/foundation/Workspace.aspx?workspaceId=54

In certain scenarios, there may be requirements to provide supplemental information not available in the User-Agent header and captured via different methods. Examples are retrieving hardware, IP, or MAC addresses, mobile IMEI number, etc. Some of the more likely use cases are High Risk Transactions (HRT) requests but this field may also be used when there is a need for more granular tracking of the request.    For examples: https://wik.unionbank.com:8443/display/EA/SOA%3A+RPC+Headers#SOA:RPCHeaders-REST
The datetime the client sends the request.
This Uuid is an identifier which may be shared by multiple operation invocations if there is orchestration.
Datetime the provider sent the response.
The User Session Id is available for providers that require the client application to maintain a separate user session similar to a system-to-system session with the oAuth bearer token. A system level session may span multiple User sessions based on the architecture of that implementation.
The id of the user that is making the request using an application defined in X-MUFG-Application-Id  The id can be but is not limited to the MUFG employee id for associate facing channel applications or sso hash id for online banking applications

This identifies a customer's digital access to account info, such as a PTT Access Id. PTT access ID is generated when a customer enroll into online or telephone banking, and now express banking (first time through if not already an online customer). It is unique to a customer. It is kept on SSO as a xref to get from UI customer created userid to the PTT customer records. It is also on CIF as an account for the CIF no for that customer. One customer (CIF Number) may have one PTT access ID, with the exception of businesses which will generate have a unique PTT ID for each employee able to do online banking for that company. (IBB)
CustomerId is the primary key used to identify a unique customer. This is not encoded or concatenated with other values.
Most customers (not vanilla consumer) are assigned into a group. This group determines what services can be provided, and by whom, and also affects pricing and other business rules that may impact the customer.  Three letter code.

Maximum number of rows to return in the result set.
This is the logical page of data returned - page 1 is the first set of results. This is to be used in combination with pagingLimit and fine with small data sets, but for very large data sets the performance can degrade.
The paging token is provided by the provider system as a value representing 'we left off here'. It must be unique for all members of a collection.   To use the paging token, it is passed back in when the next call is made, and the provider system will start from that point in returning the next page of records.

Count of PPW Items which are pending approval. PPW - Positive Pay on the Web: Brief Description This application will allow business customers to view their Positive Pay exceptions and the corresponding check images on the web. This will also give them the ability to decide how to resolve the exception from a list of predefined disposition methods. Positive Pay on the Web (PPW), is a web based Union Bank application which provides service to the bank's business customers. This will be available to business customers who sign up for this service. Positive Pay is a valuable product for both the customer and the bank as it mitigates the check fraud. Account Reconciliation System (ART) processes the items and identifies the exceptions, which need action from the customers. ART transmits the exceptions to PPW so that the customers can review those exceptions and make dispositions. The Positive Pay on the Web application will present the entitled user to view exception reports for each account. The user will be able to make a decision on all or selected items as needed. The system also supports the dual control for exception decisions and issue inputs. The user will also be able to click on the item and view an image prior to making the decision. This application is integrated with Online Business Center. Overall Architecture: PPW uses Oracle 11g for its database. PPW runs within SSO frame. PPW Administration component runs independently outside of SSO frame, but is also integrated with SSO Administration and can be linked over from SSOA. PPW provides WebService endpoint for B-2-B services (provides services to Mobile and Dashboard applications). Through IBM MQ, PPW sends information on accounts, items, and activities to ART Mainframe, and receives information of accounts, items from ART Mainframe on a daily basis. PPW also provides OEUA component that allows external users to administrate the user accounts through SSO and MDB.

WRI=Web Return Items: Return Items Solution will enable business customers to view their returned items on-line along with the corresponding check image and decision on their items, if they subscribe to the service. Returned Items on the Web is an application by which a bank customer can view their Returned Items along with corresponding check images. There are two primary services provided through this application: viewing actual deposited items returned and viewing of early warning notifications of large dollar deposited items returned. With in the service that allows viewing of deposited items returned, there are two options available for the client, Inquiry Only and Inquiry with Decisioning, which will be primarily offered to the Title/Escrow Industry. For clients setup on Inquiry with Decisioning they would make a charge-back or re-clear decision for each decisionable item, as well as be able to inquire upon those that are not decisionable. In either case whether the item is decisionable or available only for inquiry the corresponding check image would be available for viewing. The decisions will automatically feed into Union Bank Returned Items System for automated processing. Manual intervention by Returned Item Operations is required to input the decisions into TRIPS, using the decision report. Once Operations has input them, then automated processing continues in TRIPS. For clients that are setup on Inquiry Only, they would also have access to items being returned to their account and the associated images, but the disposition on those items would be final. During the setup period for the product the client will define which items will be reported to the web. Not all items are required to be reported to the web, the client can select which items are reported based upon dollar limits. The bank's client can also query by date and account number/location combination to view and download returned items. The can also

MUFG Customer identifier (CustomerId) is unique identifier assigned by the RCIF system for a given legal entity or natural person, an obligor or guarantor. The unique CIF Number is generated based on the Customer Name, accumulation ID and Tiebreaker in RCIF. The current RCIF application supports a 9 character numeric value. Alternative identifiers are: taxpayer identification number (taxId) Combination of customer name, accumulationId, and tiebreaker EnterpriseIdentifier.identifier is Alphanumeric id like UUID/GUID.
This is the application ID from GSI. The complete list of GSI Ids are here:https://ebcm.unionbank.com/Archer/foundation/Workspace.aspx?workspaceId=-1&requestUrl=  We have customers in multiple systems of record. This value represents what is the system of record for the customer.
Part of Alt ID: Name, accum tiebreaker - Accumulation Identifier - for an'INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER': The'accum'is derived from the first name by adding up values for each letter in that name: A = 1, B = 2, etc.'David'would yield 4+1+22+9+4 = 40. For a'NON-INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER: The'accum'is derived from the second word in the name, similar to the'INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER formula.
Company identifier for a customer is typically associated with a unique identifier of the financial institution. Examples: PurePoint Financial MUFG Union
CustomerId is the primary key used to identify a unique customer in CIF. Alternative keys include: name + accumulationId + tiebreaker taxpayer identification number
Part of Alt ID: name, accum tiebreaker OR the entire concatentated KEY alternative customer key is customer name, and accum value and tiebreaker. MUB restriction is 14 characters (soundex name) MUB restriction is 40 characters (fullName)

standard IP address format 168.192.000.001
The HTTP referer (originally a misspelling of referrer[1]) is an optional HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage (i.e. the URI or IRI) which is linked to the resource being requested. By checking the referrer, the new webpage can see where the request originated.   In the most common situation this means that when a user clicks a hyperlink in a web browser, the browser sends a request to the server holding the destination webpage. The request may include the referer field, which indicates the last page the user was on (the one where they clicked the link).   Referer logging is used to allow websites and web servers to identify where people are visiting them from, for promotional or statistical purposes   The default behaviour of referer leaking puts websites at risk of privacy and security breaches.
user Agent in http header. In HTTP, the User-Agent string is often used for content negotiation, where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in RFC 1945 'for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations.”
http Protocol header language The Content-Language entity header is used to describe the language(s) intended for the audience, so that it allows a user to differentiate according to the users'own preferred language.    For example, if 'Content-Language: de-DE'is set, it says that the document is intended for German language speakers (however, it doesn't indicate the document is written in German. For example, it might be written in English as part of a language course for German speakers. If you want to indicate which language the document is written in, use the lang attribute instead).  If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the content is intended for all language audiences. Multiple language tags are also possible, as well as applying the Content-Language header to various media types and not only to textual documents.
Standard Http Header - full description of language. The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but  restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a  response to the request.    Accept-Language = 'Accept-Language'':' 1#( language-range [ ';''q''='qvalue ] )  language-range = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( '-'1*8ALPHA ) ) | '*')    Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which  represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages  specified by that range. The quality value defaults to 'q=1'. For  example,    Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7    would mean: 'I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and  other types of English.'A language-range matches a language-tag if  it exactly equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the  tag such that the first tag character following the prefix is '-'.  The special range '*', if present in the Accept-Language field,  matches every tag not matched by any other range present in the  Accept-Language field.
Browser generated script that is used to gather user and browser's information - passed to risk analysis engine for scoring evaluation.  A device fingerprint, machine fingerprint, or browser fingerprint is information collected about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. Fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual users or devices even when persistent cookies (and also zombie cookies) can't be read or stored in the browser, the client IP address is hidden, and even if one switches to another browser on the same device. This may allow a remote application to detect and prevent online identity theft and credit card fraud, but also to compile long-term records of individuals'browsing histories even when they're attempting to avoid tracking, raising a major concern for internet privacy advocates. Some computer security experts consider the ease of bulk parameter extraction offered by web browsers to be a security hole.
http protocol header field: The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.    Accept = 'Accept'':' #( media-range [ accept-params ] )  media-range = ( '*/*' | ( type '/''*')  | ( type '/'subtype )  ) *( ';'parameter )  accept-params = ';''q''='qvalue *( accept-extension )  accept-extension = ';'token [ '='( token | quoted-string ) ]

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWTare encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.
An encryption key is a random string of bits created explicitly for scrambling and unscrambling data. Encryption keys are designed with algorithms intended to ensure that every key is unpredictable and unique.

MARKETING INTERSTITAL PAGE Value  Definition  An advertisement that loads between two content pages.  Information  One of the most common interstitials is the pop-up ad. Another emerging format is a full-page ad that interrupts sequential content, forcing exposure to the advertisement before visitors can continue on their content path. Interstitials are a form of interruption marketing. This quality appeals to advertisers who feel Web advertising needs to be more like a broadcast medium to be effective.  Interstitials often draw an above average amount of response and resentment. The high response rates typically translate into higher CPM rates. The high level of resentment may translate into consumer backlash, although the exact long-term effects are unclear.

Close Business Account typically uses Arrangement to 'close'the account portion of an Arrangement. Terminate Arrangement supports larger, more complex processing, particularly needed for credit related arrangements <AccountFinanceServiceArrangement> - where payoff steps are required before the arrangement can be terminated. Even closing a Deposit Account requires a disbursement of funds. As a result, passing in just the 'arrangement'is not adequate for closing a business account, which is why this Information Content was created.

The company code represents the origination entity of the Product Arrangement (i.e. in what place or system the arrangement was initiated). Often, this corresponds to a geographic sublocation, such as a U.S. State (FL, NC, NY), but may not be.
The product code represents the specific product the customer is receiving - these values are defined by the different systems of record, and consequently will be of different lengths and values.  For example from one system the value might be 'CHK'for a checking account, where from another system the value might be 'Checking', all depending upon the system where the data is coming from.  One system may return SAV, and another return Savings.

Is the pin encrypted using Data Encryption Standard (DES). The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a cryptographic algorithm used by most of today's financial industry to provide confidentiality and message integrity. DES was created by IBM and partners. DES encryption requires encryptedPin + encryption key (KPEkey) isDESencrypted == TRUE
In cryptography, Derived Unique Key Per Transaction (DUKPT) is a key management scheme in which for every transaction, a unique key is used which is derived from a fixed key. Therefore, if a derived key is compromised, future and past transaction data are still protected since the next or prior keys cannot be determined easily. DUKPT encryption requires encryptedPin + ksnKey and may require encryption key (basekey) isDUKPTencrypted == TRUE

"Demand Deposit

REVIEWED BY JAMES CHEN AND MITCHELL GRANT

Updated Apr 9, 2019



What Is a Demand Deposit?

A demand deposit consists of funds held in an account from which deposited funds can be withdrawn at any time from the depository institution, such as a checking or savings account, accessible by a teller, ATM or online banking.

In contrast, a term deposit is a type of account that cannot be accessed for a predetermined period of time. M1 is a category of the money supply that includes demand deposits as well as physical money and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts that have no maturity period but limited withdrawals or transfers.

How Demand Deposits Work

Demand deposits provide the money consumers need for paying daily expenses. If depositors were required to notify their financial institutions before withdrawing funds, the depositors would have challenges making everyday purchases and paying bills.

Characteristics of Demand Deposit Accounts

Demand deposit accounts (DDAs) may have joint owners. Both owners must sign when opening the account, but only one owner must sign when closing the account. Either owner may deposit or withdraw funds and sign checks without permission from the other owner.

Financial institutions typically create minimum balances for demand deposit accounts. Accounts falling below the minimum value typically are assessed a fee each time the balance drops below the required value.

Although negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and money market accounts (MMAs) let holders deposit and withdraw funds on demand and typically pay market interest rates, they are not DDA accounts. MMAs typically limit withdrawals, or transactions including deposits, withdrawals and transfers, to six per month. Fees may apply if the limit is exceeded.

Requirements for Demand Deposits

Federal Reserve Regulation Q prohibits financial institutions from paying interest on demand deposits. However, the institution may give an account holder cash or credit payments or merchandise when opening an account. The account holder may not receive more than two payments annually, and the value of each payment may not exceed $10 for deposits under $5,000 and $20 for deposits exceeding $5,000.

The amount of cash reserves a financial institution is keeping either in its vault or deposited with the Federal Reserve depends on the amount of demand deposits the institution is holding. The greater the amount of demand deposits, the more cash the institution reserves.

Example of a Demand Deposit

In July 2016, Bank First reported net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $3.76 million, or $0.60 per share. The numbers represented an 11% increase in quarterly earnings over the same quarter the previous year. The increase was partly due to growth in demand deposit balances, which are a low-cost source of funding for the bank.

Key Takeaways

•	Demand deposits provide the money consumers need for paying daily expenses and can be withdrawn at any time from the depository institution via a checking or savings account, a teller, an ATM, or through online banking.

•	The Federal Reserve prohibits financial institutions from paying interest on demand deposits.

•	There may be one owner to a demand deposit account.

The available balance is the balance in checking or on-demand accounts that is free for use by the customer or account holder. These are funds that are available for immediate use, and includes deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and any other activity that has already cleared to or from the account. A credit card account's available balance is normally referred to as available credit.  An account holder's available balance may be different from the current balance. The current balance generally includes any pending transactions that haven't been cleared.
Average balance last 12 months. The average balance is the account balance calculated over a chosen period of time based upon multiple closing balances over that period of time. Averages are most commonly calculated on a daily or monthly basis. An average daily balance adds the closing balances at the end of each day in a given period of time and divides the sum by the number of calendar days in that period. An average monthly balance sums the closing balance at the end of each day and divides it by the number of calendar days in the month. A simple average balance between a beginning and ending date is calculated by dividing the beginning balance plus the ending balance by two.
Average balance last 3 months. The average balance is the account balance calculated over a chosen period of time based upon multiple closing balances over that period of time. Averages are most commonly calculated on a daily or monthly basis. An average daily balance adds the closing balances at the end of each day in a given period of time and divides the sum by the number of calendar days in that period. An average monthly balance sums the closing balance at the end of each day and divides it by the number of calendar days in the month. A simple average balance between a beginning and ending date is calculated by dividing the beginning balance plus the ending balance by two.
Average balance last 6 months. The average balance is the account balance calculated over a chosen period of time based upon multiple closing balances over that period of time.

Cash Reserve Available Balance - need better definition TBD
The ledger balance and available balance are terms used by a bank for the cash position of a checking account. The ledger balance is the balance available as of the beginning of the day. The available balance may be defined in two different ways; they are: The ledger balance, plus or minus any subsequent activity during the day; essentially, it is the ending balance at any point in time during the day; or The ledger balance, minus any checks deposited but not yet made available for the use of the account holder, as well as other credits that have not yet been posted to the account. The latter definition is more commonly used. Thus, in most situations, the primary difference between the ledger balance and available balance is checks that the company or individual has deposited in his account, but which the bank has not yet made available for use. The reason for this delay is that the bank must first be paid by the bank of the entity that issued the check. Once the cash has been transferred, the cash will be made available to the account holder.
This field mainly collects the lockbox balance which doesn't show as available balance in teller 680 screen. TNA receives the lock box deposit (including the amount immediately available and the float) from CMS and currently displays it on the work-in-process inquiry screen 614.
Calculated Available balance as a sum of Available balance and Work in Progress Amount
In some places pre-authorizations (such as at gas stations) are charged to the account when a debit card is used. This balance reflects those pre-authorizations. If none have occured, this will be the same as the available balance.

checking account cash balance after deducting checks drawn on other banks. Generally defined as account ledger balances, less unpaid checks in the process of collection. A bank may count a deposited check as funds available for use by its customer in two business days, but usually will not include it in the depositor's collected balance for five or six days. This allows time for the drawer bank to return the check because of insufficient funds in the check maker's account or for other reasons. Contrast with available balance.
Balance which is unavailable for customer's use. When a bank places a hold on a customer account, a portion of the balance becomes unavailable for use for a defined period.
Overdraft Coverage Balance For example, if the user has say $100.00 balance in checking Acct A, $200.00 in Checking acct B, $1000.00 in Savings Acct C and a , the coverage balance for Acct A is $1200.00.
Smallest balance amount allowed in the overdraft account.
This balance is computed this way:   Initialize first with the available balance    Adds the Accrued Interest.   then subtracts the Interest withheld amount   If amount >1.00 then substracts the fee. If amount < 1.00 then this is the final value.    After subtracting the Fee if the amount is > 1.00 then this is final. If it is <1.00 then it will set as $1.00

The customer has signed up for the service to cover checks written for more than what is available in his account.

Amount of memo posting      Memo posting:      Memo-posting is a term used in traditional computerized banking environments where batch processing is employed. It represents temporary credit or debit transactions/entries made to an account for which the complete posting to update the balance will be done as part of EOD (end-of-day) batch processing. The temporary transaction created as part of the memo-posting will be reversed/removed after the actual transaction is posted in batch processing. Some modern banking systems implement real-time posting.      Examples:      A customer receives an electronic credit to his account with the current day as the effective date. The actual transaction for this entry will be made at EOD in batch posting. In order for him to access the electronic credit for which he is eligible, the bank creates a temporary 'memo'credit to increase the balance available (withdrawal). Later, this entry will be removed as part of the EOD batch process.   The actual transaction to record a withdrawal using ATM will be posted to accounts in the EOD batch. In order to prevent a customer from overdrawing his account later in the day, the amount of the cash withdrawal is memo-posted as a charge to his account until the transaction actually posts in the batch update that evening.      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memo_posting

A bank may count a deposited check as funds available for use by its customer in two business days, but usually will not include it in the depositor's collected balance for five or six days. This allows time for the drawer bank to return the check because of insufficient funds in the check maker's account or for other reasons. Contrast with available balance.

Credit Rating vs. Credit Score: An Overview Credit rating and credit score might be used interchangeably in some cases, but there is a distinction between these two phrases. A credit rating, often expressed as a letter grade, conveys the creditworthiness of a business or government. A credit score, usually given as a number, is also an expression of creditworthiness that can be used for businesses or individual consumers. Certain credit scores (for instance, the Dun & Bradstreet PAYDEX, Experian's Intelliscore Plus, or the FICO LiquidCredit Small Business Scoring Service) apply exclusively to businesses. As a consumer, your credit score is a number based on information from your credit reports at the three major credit reporting bureaus-Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. When it comes to applying for a personal loan, a mortgage or a new credit card, you'll be interested in your personal credit score. Both ratings and scores are designed to show potential lenders and creditors a borrower's likelihood of repaying a debt. They are created by independent third parties, rather than by creditors or consumers. These services are paid for by the entity requesting the credit score as well as by the creditor. - https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/whats-difference-between-credit-rating-and-credit-score.asp
Credit ratings can address a corporation's financial instruments i.e. debt security such as a bond, but also the corporations itself. Ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, the largest of which are Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings. They use letter designations such as A, B, C. Higher grades are intended to represent a lower probability of default.

A credit score is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a credit report, information typically sourced from credit bureaus. Lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system. Credit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the creditworthiness of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.
A credit bureau is a data collection agency that gathers account information from various creditors and provides that information to a consumer reporting agency. In the United States, there are 3 major ones: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion
The most recent date of the score

date the GL Transaction was posted.
This the id of the monetary transaction (it could be from any system) that is the source for the GL entry to be made.   It's not the id of the GL transaction, but something like a deposit, a payment, a transfer, etc.
This number is created by the teller client software as a unique id. This is created as a unique identifier for the reconciliation data and to indicate that the teller system has already posted the monetary transaction, such as in the case of safe deposit boxes, where the create transaction is written to a Kafka topic.
When the client sends reconciliation data, sometimes it will provide the transactionId from the SOR. If it does not have it, it will be left blank. When it is left blank, later processing in the flow will copy the tellerSystemTransactionId into this field.
the amount to be posted to the GL Account.
the source system that gl uses to identify the gl account.
Possible values: DDA transaction can come from multiple sources [MIC, PTT, PEP etc., to name few] – with this change, corresponding GL transaction has one of these values.   Used for aggregation.
Some systems have more than one GL account they use - the sequence number will identify the correct account within the source system.
This is the context that the transaction will be created within, needed so that settlement GL transactions can be correctly created.

unique transaction Identifier - provided typically by the system of record.
"A transaction packet is a collection of monetary transactions, and it is typically created when a customer gives to the teller a mixture of checks, cash, and possibly a request for cashier's checks or cash back. A packet may have multiple debits and credits.  It is also used in transfer transactions.
"
"When a transaction comes from another system, this id is the combination of the system id and tran id in the source so it's a different unique for a transaction in P8.
In P8 it's called externalTransactionId.
"
"A numeric field used to identify the providing source. This will represent the internal source that creates the transaction within the MUB domain and may not represent the true origination of the transaction.    Example InClearing will use '001'which represents 'ICS'.  It is the numeric form of the GSI.  TEP came up with this.
This is the intermediary source."
A numeric identifier that the external system provides that permits us to refer to this specific transaction within that system. This identifier should be unique in perpetuity such that we do not need to further qualify to access this specific transaction   within that system. The structure is up to the provider, although a sample pattern will be provided below.   Example; PEP uses a PAR field (PEP Assigned Reference) on every transaction that comes across in a NACHA file. This is used to tie items together back in the PEP system. It will be perpetually unique and can be drawn upon at any later date to refer to   that item.
This is a compound field that can be used in COBOL to refer to the full 8 bytes as a single variable. This is sometimes the exact same value for all transactions in a file if it is the batch number and sequence number.
A numeric field that represent the 'Business Source'that was originally the first 4 bytes of the old reference number (also known as BATCH-NBR). This removes the previous overloading of the field and provides for the value here as a separate field. The   number has become important to many downstream systems and is used in different manners so the most prudent choice for backwards compatibility was to support the value in its current form.  This is not the Batch Number.  Example values are ?  
Business date of the transaction.

For each transaction code, there is a string associated with it that is as unique as the tran code itself is. It is used so that the name can be passed instead of the tran code. For example, the tran code may be 892, the description might be'Check Withdrawl, and the text for the code is'CheckWithdrawal'(notice no spaces). This means the full name and the description could be different.

UETR is an ISO2022 standard reference to uniquely track a transaction across distributed systems. SWIFT and Real-Time Payments have already implemented this in the marketplace. The long term architecture should move to UETR/UUID to provide a perpetually unique transaction ID across all systems.   • UETR (UUID) is adopted by Digital One but not currently passed to Profile.    • RTP in MUB implements UUID already but this will not be passed in Phase 1, Phase 2 TBD   • UETR/UUID is needed for Holds to represent the specific item and will be passed through ICS and MIC   • UETR ISO2022 is the standard and the contents are synonymous with UUID and GUID

Census Tract. Code that specifies the location of the customers residence or business. Census data populated manually or by other apps via batch updates. Free form fields in format ____ - __ - ___. 4 bytes, 2 bytes, 3 bytes This field is formatted in Census Tract (4 bytes) Census Sector (2 bytes), Census Block (3 bytes).
Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. Census tracts were first used in the 2000 census. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Each US county has atlas one census tract. Census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are designed with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction and new developments, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix.
The first digit of the census block number identifies the block group. Census blocks are statistical areas bounded by visible features such as roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries such as property lines, city, township, school district, county limits and short line-of-sight extensions of roads. Census blocks are numbered uniquely with a four-digit census block number from 0000 to 9999 within census tract, which nest within state and county. The first digit of the census block number identifies the block group. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . ., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract
Metropolitan Statistical Area value - Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) are delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as having at least one urbanized area with a minimum population of 50,000. This is used for the community reinvestment programs.
Census Counties are numbered uniquely with a three-digit census county number which nested with a state. Each county will have a unique value. Example: 067 = Sacramento County

A credit score is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a credit report, information typically sourced from credit bureaus. Lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system. Credit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the creditworthiness of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.

Financial institution fraud solution users (for example, those writing policy rules or working alerts) should be able to recognize the values in this field, and differentiate between systems that use the same type of channel. For example, if the financial institution has different online banking websites for different segments of clients, a value should be specified that indicates which online banking site was used. In addition, the financial institution should specify values that identify when the channel system used is owned by a Third Party Provider (TPP), which submits transactions to the financial institution via an Open Banking Gateway (and thereby differentiate between the financial institute’s mobile application and the TPP's mobile application). NOTE: When the access is via a Third Party Provider’s website or mobile application, the isOpenBankingGatewayTransaction field should also be set to True.

NOTE: It is not mandatory to supply Transaction Keys but it is recommended to do so for implementations which use policy rules to trigger actions on transactions such as challenge, step-up, delay or block. Providing a Transaction Key enables the solution to include the client's unique identifier for the transaction in the scoring response along with triggered policy actions.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionLocalDateTime (not sent?) The local date and time of the transaction. When receiving transaction version, this field holds the local time and date of the current version.

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionOriginationSystemCd. A code representing the system / application in which this transaction was originally created or first presented to the Bank. For example, a code that users of the fraud system will recognize as representing the online banking platform, mobile application, IVR system, call center, branch application or file transfer program in which the transaction was originated or first presented to the bank. When the transaction versioning feature is used, the value of this field is constant for all versions of the same transaction.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionSendinSystemCd. A code representing the system/application that is the integration point, or the system/application that is sending the transaction to the Actimize service for scoring. This field is primarily relevant in implementations in which there is more than one integration point; often such implementations make use of the transaction versioning feature. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionType. The client transaction type code. When this includes a service activity, such as an address or password change or a non-monetary servicing action (such as, Card Issue), additional detail on the transaction type should be provided in the servicesTransactionTypeCd field. NOTE: In Commercial Banking, for bulk payments, a value for this field must be provided at the bulk payment level and at the entry level. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information.

When available as part of the Web Device Data field, this field is calculated by the solution. Otherwise, the client may pass this field into the solution directly. Format should be WidthXHeight, for example, 800X600.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionHeaderProxyAuthorization (not sent?) Field appears in wsdl, but doesn't appear in documentation supplied by Actimize.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionHeaderUserAgent. The client session information from the HTTP header data, such as web browser type, plug-ins. If the HTTP Header information is provided in the webSessionHTTPHeaderFields field, then this field does not need to be populated.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionSessionIPAddress. The client browser IP address that initiated the session. The solution applies IP enrichment to this field for all channels and transaction types.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: User.UserLoginName. The user name utilized by the online user to login to the online session. This may be the same as the User ID, or may be unique where the financial institution utilizes an internal identifier as the User ID. NOTE: The main entity (meaning, party or user) can have multiple login names.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.isWebSessionSecondFactorAuthInd. Indicates whether the client passed a second factor authorization during the session.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionSessionStartDateTime. The date and time when the online session (web or mobile app) began in the time zone of the local web server. For login transactions, the value passed as webSessionStartDateTime is the same as transactionNormalizedDateTime. For transactions that follow the login in the session, the transactionNormalizedDateTime would hold the current transaction's time, whereas webSessionStartDateTime would hold the login time for that session.

Close Business Account typically uses Arrangement to 'close'the account portion of an Arrangement. Terminate Arrangement supports larger, more complex processing, particularly needed for credit related arrangements <AccountFinanceServiceArrangement> - where payoff steps are required before the arrangement can be terminated. Even closing a Deposit Account requires a disbursement of funds. As a result, passing in just the 'arrangement'is not adequate for closing a business account, which is why this Information Content was created.

Average balance last 3 months. The average balance is the account balance calculated over a chosen period of time based upon multiple closing balances over that period of time. Averages are most commonly calculated on a daily or monthly basis. An average daily balance adds the closing balances at the end of each day in a given period of time and divides the sum by the number of calendar days in that period. An average monthly balance sums the closing balance at the end of each day and divides it by the number of calendar days in the month. A simple average balance between a beginning and ending date is calculated by dividing the beginning balance plus the ending balance by two.

A simple average balance between a beginning and ending date is calculated by dividing the beginning balance plus the ending balance by two.
The beginning balance in an account on any given day. Also knows as the ledgerBalance based on the last posted date
The ledger balance and available balance are terms used by a bank for the cash position of a checking account. The ledger balance is the balance available as of the beginning of the day. The available balance may be defined in two different ways; they are: The ledger balance, plus or minus any subsequent activity during the day; essentially, it is the ending balance at any point in time during the day; or The ledger balance, minus any checks deposited but not yet made available for the use of the account holder, as well as other credits that have not yet been posted to the account. The latter definition is more commonly used. Thus, in most situations, the primary difference between the ledger balance and available balance is checks that the company or individual has deposited in his account, but which the bank has not yet made available for use. The reason for this delay is that the bank must first be paid by the bank of the entity that issued the check. Once the cash has been transferred, the cash will be made available to the account holder.

A demand deposit account (DDA) is a bank account from which deposited funds can be withdrawn at any time, without advance notice. DDA accounts can pay interest on the deposited funds but aren’t required to. Checking accounts and savings accounts are common types of DDAs.    Demand deposit accounts allow funds to be withdrawn at any time from the financial institution.     Demand deposits provide the money consumers need for cash and for daily expenses and purchases.    Demand deposit accounts pay little or no interest—the trade-off for the funds being so readily available.    Demand deposit accounts can have joint owners: Either owner may deposit or withdraw funds and sign checks without permission from the other.    Demand deposit accounts contrast to time or term deposit accounts, in which the funds are locked up for a certain period, unavailable for access without penalty, if at all.

A bank may count a deposited check as funds available for use by its customer in two business days, but usually will not include it in the depositor's collected balance for five or six days. This allows time for the drawer bank to return the check because of insufficient funds in the check maker's account or for other reasons. Contrast with available balance.
Balance which is unavailable for customer's use. When a bank places a hold on a customer account, a portion of the balance becomes unavailable for use for a defined period.
Overdraft Coverage Balance For example, if the user has say $100.00 balance in checking Acct A, $200.00 in Checking acct B, $1000.00 in Savings Acct C and a , the coverage balance for Acct A is $1200.00.
Smallest balance amount allowed in the overdraft account.
This balance is computed this way: Initialize first with the available balance Adds the Accrued Interest. then subtracts the Interest withheld amount If amount >1.00 then substracts the fee. If amount < 1.00 then this is the final value. After subtracting the Fee if the amount is > 1.00 then this is final. If it is <1.00 then it will set as $1.00
The available balance plus the total odpAvailableBalance. eg. Balance in check (1000) DOP is 5000 so total is 6000.

The ledger balance and available balance are terms used by a bank for the cash position of a checking account. The ledger balance is the balance available as of the beginning of the day. The available balance may be defined in two different ways; they are: The ledger balance, plus or minus any subsequent activity during the day; essentially, it is the ending balance at any point in time during the day; or The ledger balance, minus any checks deposited but not yet made available for the use of the account holder, as well as other credits that have not yet been posted to the account. The latter definition is more commonly used. Thus, in most situations, the primary difference between the ledger balance and available balance is checks that the company or individual has deposited in his account, but which the bank has not yet made available for use. The reason for this delay is that the bank must first be paid by the bank of the entity that issued the check. Once the cash has been transferred, the cash will be made available to the account holder.

Summary of transaction. Usage: TransactionHistory or Statement TxnSummary SHOULD BE CALLED TxnHistory
Unique identifier for a transaction - typically generated by the transaction processing system when the transaction information enters the system in a file or real time.
A transaction packet is a collection of monetary transactions, and it is typically created when a customer gives to the teller a mixture of checks, cash, and possibly a request for cashier's checks or cash back. A packet may have multiple debits and credits.
Sequence Number of the order in which the memo post happened in comparison to other memo posts on the account. Increases in increments of 1 every time a post is placed on the account.
Item level identifier for the specific item within a packet (group of transactions) which will be stored in the P8 additionalPositngDetails Name/Value pairs with the 'name'MUBitemSeq. This will be constructed with a 2 char Source Julian Day (JJJ) and the next 10 next 10 determined by originating system. (systems are encouraged to sequentially cycle numbers for remaining 10 digits. In many cases the 10 digits may contain the legacy 8 digit SRN. The value must be unique in a given day, greater uniqueness is encouraged.
If isReversal is true, then this field will have the transaction id of the transaction that is being reversed.
A reference number is a unique identifier assigned to each transaction. It may be made using a credit or debit card, or it could be created by any step along the posting process to provide a lineage for the other steps that were taken to get the transaction to the SOR.  A unique reference number is technologically created and designated for a single transaction.
Some transactions cause other transactions to be created, such as when a customer initiates a transaction, such as a wire transfer, that will cause fees to be generated. So this element represents the array of packet Ids for fees that were created from specific transaction being created.
This element represents the channel that was used when the transaction was first created. When the transaction is created, the system will persist the originating channel so it can be returned with the other transaction information. The valid values will be as listed here: https://prod-1-confluence.mufgamericas.com/x/uIzrCQ and are the same as what is passed in via the X-MUFG-Channel-ID.

Effective Date/Time. The date/time that an associated action resulting in a change of state or status of an object took effect.
Amount of memo posting Memo posting: Memo-posting is a term used in traditional computerized banking environments where batch processing is employed. It represents temporary credit or debit transactions/entries made to an account for which the complete posting to update the balance will be done as part of EOD (end-of-day) batch processing. The temporary transaction created as part of the memo-posting will be reversed/removed after the actual transaction is posted in batch processing. Some modern banking systems implement real-time posting. Examples: A customer receives an electronic credit to his account with the current day as the effective date. The actual transaction for this entry will be made at EOD in batch posting. In order for him to access the electronic credit for which he is eligible, the bank creates a temporary 'memo'credit to increase the balance available (withdrawal). Later, this entry will be removed as part of the EOD batch process. The actual transaction to record a withdrawal using ATM will be posted to accounts in the EOD batch. In order to prevent a customer from overdrawing his account later in the day, the amount of the cash withdrawal is memo-posted as a charge to his account until the transaction actually posts in the batch update that evening. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memo_posting

For each transaction code, there is a string associated with it that is as unique as the tran code itself is. It is used so that the name can be passed instead of the tran code. For example, the tran code may be 892, the description might be'Check Withdrawl, and the text for the code is'CheckWithdrawal'(notice no spaces). This means the full name and the description could be different.
This is the description corresponding to the trancode from the system of record.

Needed to support transfers and other financial events where a an amount is debited or credited to a specific account.

unique transaction Identifier - provided typically by the system of record.
For some transactions, such as transfers, there will be a transaction id associated with the transfer as a whole that would be the parent of the resulting debit and credit - that would be the originating transaction Id.
A numeric field used to identify the providing source. This will represent the internal source that creates the transaction within the MUB domain and may not represent the true origination of the transaction.   Example InClearing will use '001'which represents 'ICS'. The list of sources can be found  below.
A numeric identifier that the external system provides that permits us to refer to this specific transaction within that system. This identifier should be unique in perpetuity such that we do not need to further qualify to access this specific transaction  within that system. The structure is up to the provider, although a sample pattern will be provided below.  Example; PEP uses a PAR field (PEP Assigned Reference) on every transaction that comes across in a NACHA file. This is used to tie items together back in the PEP system. It will be perpetually unique and can be drawn upon at any later date to refer to  that item.
This is a compound field that can be used in COBOL to refer to the full 8 bytes as a single variable. This is sometimes the exact same value for all transactions in a file if it is the file name and sequence number.
A numeric field that represent the 'Business Source'that was originally the first 4 bytes of the old reference number (also known as BATCH-NBR). This removes the previous overloading of the field and provides for the value here as a separate field. The  number has become important to many downstream systems and is used in different manners so the most prudent choice for backwards compatibility was to support the value in its current form.
Business date of the transaction.
the date that the transaction should be considered as posted to the account. Format is ISO 8601 standard.
the date/time that the transaction should be considered as posted to the account. Format for Date/Time is ISO 8601 standard.
Identifies a classification of AccountingTransaction based on their effect on the modeled organization's accounts. The Values defined for this Enumeration are representative and do not comprise an exhaustive list. Valid Values include:Account Closure , Account Opening , Asset Acquisition Transaction , Asset Disposal , Asset Exchange , Bill Payment , Check Presentment , Commission Payment , Contribution , Currency Exchange , Deposit , Disbursement , Inpayment , Other , Outpayment , Repayment , Tax Payment , Transfer , Withdrawal
Provider specific transactionCode. Note: this tightly couples the service implementation to the service contract, but may be required in order to integrate with existing service consumers.
For each transaction code, there is a string associated with it that is as unique as the tran code itself is. It is used so that the name can be passed instead of the tran code. For example, the tran code may be 892, the description might be'Check Withdrawl, and the text for the code is'CheckWithdrawal'(notice no spaces). This means the full name and the description could be different.
A transaction code is configured with a description for that code. This is that standard description, which will be the same for the same transaction code.
Indicates if this transaction is a correcting a previous transaction.

Indicates whether the amount is a credited or debited amount. Values are Debit, Credit

note field to record instruction or other relevant info.
This identifies the source (branch or channel) from which the transaction was initiated. If the transaction originated from a branch, this will be the branch ID, or if it originated from a servicing application, it will be an identifier for the servicing channel such as mobile, web, IVR, etc...
True if this transaction caused the running balance to go negative, and this transaction is flagged as the one that caused the NSF state.
Teller Terminal from where this advance transaction is initiated.
For channel applications, this will be transaction reference number. For batch application like TEP, batch sequence number can be used as reference.
Memo post sequence number for a line of credit account in a given day before the hard posting.    Memo post transactions are retained till they are hard posted. Hard post happen at the end of the day.
True if the account will be overdrawn with this transaction, but that is required to occur for some types of transactions, such as Lock Box.
standardEntryClassCode   NACHA requires that when a transaction is submitted for processing,  the transaction must include an ACH Standard Entry Class (SEC) Code   to designate how the transaction was authorized by the originator.  Codes and descriptions are here: https://prod-1-confluence.mufgamericas.com/x/Jp_9C

This will be constructed with a 2 char Source Julian Day (JJJ) and the next 10 next 10 determined by originating system. (systems are encouraged to sequentially cycle numbers for remaining 10 digits. In many cases the 10 digits may contain the legacy 8 digit SRN. The value must be unique in a given day, greater uniqueness is encouraged.
UETR is an ISO2022 standard reference to uniquely track a transaction across distributed systems. SWIFT and Real-Time Payments have already implemented this in the marketplace. The long term architecture should move to UETR/UUID to provide a perpetually unique transaction ID across all systems.  • UETR (UUID) is adopted by Digital One but not currently passed to Profile.   • RTP in MUB implements UUID already but this will not be passed in Phase 1, Phase 2 TBD  • UETR/UUID is needed for Holds to represent the specific item and will be passed through ICS and MIC  • UETR ISO2022 is the standard and the contents are synonymous with UUID and GUID

Available balance for Cash Reserve (an unsecured overdraft line tied to a personal checking account).
Checking account cash balance after deducting checks drawn on other banks. Generally defined as account ledger balances, less unpaid checks in the process of collection. A bank may count a deposited check as funds available for use by its customer in two business days, but usually will not include it in the depositor's collected balance for five or six days. This allows time for the drawer bank to return the check because of insufficient funds in the check maker's account or for other reasons. Contrast with available balance.

authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)     Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a term for a framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the information necessary to bill for services. These combined processes are considered important for effective network management and security.    As the first process, authentication provides a way of identifying a user, typically by having the user enter a valid user name and valid password before access is granted. The process of authentication is based on each user having a unique set of criteria for gaining access. The AAA server compares a user's authentication credentials with other user credentials stored in a database. If the credentials match, the user is granted access to the network. If the credentials are at variance, authentication fails and network access is denied.    Following authentication, a user must gain authorization for doing certain tasks. After logging into a system, for instance, the user may try to issue commands. The authorization process determines whether the user has the authority to issue such commands. Simply put, authorization is the process of enforcing policies: determining what types or qualities of activities, resources, or services a user is permitted. Usually, authorization occurs within the context of authentication. Once you have authenticated a user, they may be authorized for different types of access or activity.    The final plank in the AAA framework is accounting, which measures the resources a user consumes during access. This can include the amount of system time or the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during a session. Accounting is carried out by logging of session statistics and usage information and is used for authorization control, billing, trend analysis, resource utilization, and capacity planning activities.

Credit Rating vs. Credit Score: An Overview Credit rating and credit score might be used interchangeably in some cases, but there is a distinction between these two phrases. A credit rating, often expressed as a letter grade, conveys the creditworthiness of a business or government. A credit score, usually given as a number, is also an expression of creditworthiness that can be used for businesses or individual consumers. Certain credit scores (for instance, the Dun & Bradstreet PAYDEX, Experian's Intelliscore Plus, or the FICO LiquidCredit Small Business Scoring Service) apply exclusively to businesses. As a consumer, your credit score is a number based on information from your credit reports at the three major credit reporting bureaus-Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. When it comes to applying for a personal loan, a mortgage or a new credit card, you'll be interested in your personal credit score. Both ratings and scores are designed to show potential lenders and creditors a borrower's likelihood of repaying a debt. They are created by independent third parties, rather than by creditors or consumers. These services are paid for by the entity requesting the credit score as well as by the creditor. - https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/whats-difference-between-credit-rating-and-credit-score.asp
Credit ratings can address a corporation's financial instruments i.e. debt security such as a bond, but also the corporations itself. Ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, the largest of which are Standard& Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings. They use letter designations such as A, B, C. Higher grades are intended to represent a lower probability of default.

MUFG Customer identifier (CustomerId) is unique identifier assigned by the RCIF system for a given legal entity or natural person, an obligor or guarantor. The unique CIF Number is generated based on the Customer Name, accumulation ID and Tiebreaker in RCIF. The current RCIF application supports a 9 character numeric value. Alternative identifiers are: taxpayer identification number (taxId) Combination of customer name, accumulationId, and tiebreaker EnterpriseIdentifier.identifier is Alphanumeric id like UUID/GUID.
This is the application ID from GSI. The complete list of GSI Ids are here:https://ebcm.unionbank.com/Archer/foundation/Workspace.aspx?workspaceId=-1&requestUrl=  We have customers in multiple systems of record. This value represents what is the system of record for the customer.
Part of Alt ID: Name, accum tiebreaker - Accumulation Identifier - for an'INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER': The'accum'is derived from the first name by adding up values for each letter in that name: A = 1, B = 2, etc.'David'would yield 4+1+22+9+4 = 40. For a'NON-INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER: The'accum'is derived from the second word in the name, similar to the'INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER formula.
Company identifier for a customer is typically associated with a unique identifier of the financial institution. Examples: PurePoint Financial MUFG Union
CustomerId is the primary key used to identify a unique customer in CIF. Alternative keys include: name + accumulationId + tiebreaker taxpayer identification number
Part of Alt ID: name, accum tiebreaker OR the entire concatentated KEY alternative customer key is customer name, and accum value and tiebreaker. MUB restriction is 14 characters (soundex name) MUB restriction is 40 characters (fullName)
Part of alt ID: name, accum tiebreaker alternative customer key is to use name, accum value and tiebreaker.

A credit score is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the creditworthiness of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a credit report, information typically sourced from credit bureaus. Lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt. Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits. Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or identity scoring prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a trusted system. Credit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.
In the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the creditworthiness of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.Channel. Domain values of all supported channels (Web, Phone, Mobile Application, Offline, POS, ATM, Branch, Other) through which the transaction occurred. Financial institution fraud solution users (for example, those writing policy rules or working alerts) should be able to recognize the values in this field, and differentiate between systems that use the same type of channel. For example, if the financial institution has different online banking websites for different segments of clients, a value should be specified that indicates which online banking site was used. In addition, the financial institution should specify values that identify when the channel system used is owned by a Third Party Provider (TPP), which submits transactions to the financial institution via an Open Banking Gateway (and thereby differentiate between the financial institute’s mobile application and the TPP's mobile application). NOTE: When the access is via a Third Party Provider’s website or mobile application, the isOpenBankingGatewayTransaction field should also be set to True.

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionKey. A unique identifier for the transaction. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information. NOTE: It is not mandatory to supply Transaction Keys but it is recommended to do so for implementations which use policy rules to trigger actions on transactions such as challenge, step-up, delay or block. Providing a Transaction Key enables the solution to include the client's unique identifier for the transaction in the scoring response along with triggered policy actions.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionLocalDateTime (not sent?) The local date and time of the transaction. When receiving transaction version, this field holds the local time and date of the current version. The value supplied should be the date and time when the party or user performed the transaction or, for a system generated transaction, when the transaction originated at the source system. The value must be represented in the local time zone where the transaction was originated. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.Timestamp.TransactionNormalizedDateTime. The normalized date and time of the transaction. When receiving a transaction version, this field holds the normalized time and date of the current version. The normalized date and time of the transaction, equivalent to the Transaction Local Date Time, but represented in the system’s normalized time zone. The value of this field is used to sequence transactions so it is preferable to supply both date and time components. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionOriginationSystemCd. A code representing the system / application in which this transaction was originally created or first presented to the Bank. For example, a code that users of the fraud system will recognize as representing the online banking platform, mobile application, IVR system, call center, branch application or file transfer program in which the transaction was originated or first presented to the bank. When the transaction versioning feature is used, the value of this field is constant for all versions of the same transaction.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionSendinSystemCd. A code representing the system/application that is the integration point, or the system/application that is sending the transaction to the Actimize service for scoring. This field is primarily relevant in implementations in which there is more than one integration point; often such implementations make use of the transaction versioning feature. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionType. The client transaction type code. When this includes a service activity, such as an address or password change or a non-monetary servicing action (such as, Card Issue), additional detail on the transaction type should be provided in the servicesTransactionTypeCd field. NOTE: In Commercial Banking, for bulk payments, a value for this field must be provided at the bulk payment level and at the entry level. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: User.UserLoginName. The user that is associated with the transaction (or transaction version).
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionBrowserTimeZone. The difference in minutes between the browser time and GMT. When available as part of the Web Device Data field, this field is calculated by the solution. Otherwise, the client may pass this field into the solution directly.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionClientScreenResolution (not sent?) The screen resolution of the client browser used during the Internet session. When available as part of the Web Device Data field, this field is calculated by the solution. Otherwise, the client may pass this field into the solution directly. Format should be WidthXHeight, for example, 800X600.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionHeaderProxyAuthorization (not sent?) Field appears in wsdl, but doesn't appear in documentation supplied by Actimize.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionHeaderUserAgent. The client session information from the HTTP header data, such as web browser type, plug-ins. If the HTTP Header information is provided in the webSessionHTTPHeaderFields field, then this field does not need to be populated.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionSessionIPAddress. The client browser IP address that initiated the session. The solution applies IP enrichment to this field for all channels and transaction types.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: User.UserLoginName. The user name utilized by the online user to login to the online session. This may be the same as the User ID, or may be unique where the financial institution utilizes an internal identifier as the User ID. NOTE: The main entity (meaning, party or user) can have multiple login names.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.isWebSessionSecondFactorAuthInd. Indicates whether the client passed a second factor authorization during the session.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.WebSessionSessionStartDateTime. The date and time when the online session (web or mobile app) began in the time zone of the local web server. For login transactions, the value passed as webSessionStartDateTime is the same as transactionNormalizedDateTime. For transactions that follow the login in the session, the transactionNormalizedDateTime would hold the current transaction's time, whereas webSessionStartDateTime would hold the login time for that session.

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Fingerprint.Channel. Domain values of all supported channels (Web, Phone, Mobile Application, Offline, POS, ATM, Branch, Other) through which the transaction occurred. Financial institution fraud solution users (for example, those writing policy rules or working alerts) should be able to recognize the values in this field, and differentiate between systems that use the same type of channel. For example, if the financial institution has different online banking websites for different segments of clients, a value should be specified that indicates which online banking site was used. In addition, the financial institution should specify values that identify when the channel system used is owned by a Third Party Provider (TPP), which submits transactions to the financial institution via an Open Banking Gateway (and thereby differentiate between the financial institute’s mobile application and the TPP's mobile application). NOTE: When the access is via a Third Party Provider’s website or mobile application, the isOpenBankingGatewayTransaction field should also be set to True.

Financial institution fraud solution users (for example, those writing policy rules or working alerts) should be able to recognize the values in this field, and differentiate between systems that use the same type of channel. For example, if the financial institution has different online banking websites for different segments of clients, a value should be specified that indicates which online banking site was used. In addition, the financial institution should specify values that identify when the channel system used is owned by a Third Party Provider (TPP), which submits transactions to the financial institution via an Open Banking Gateway (and thereby differentiate between the financial institute’s mobile application and the TPP's mobile application). NOTE: When the access is via a Third Party Provider’s website or mobile application, the isOpenBankingGatewayTransaction field should also be set to True.

Used by Actimize analytics to determine a unique identifier for transfers where the payee account is at the same financial institution as the payor (for example, internal transfers, self-transfers, and on-us P2P transactions). Additional Information: By default, the payeeAccountKey is used as the Actimize Payee Enrichment Key for IT, ST, and P2P transactions that are known to be on-us in the Remote Banking, Commercial Banking, and Card solutions. The payeeAccountKey is relevant only for these transaction types. The Actimize Enrichment Payee Key is a calculated field that provides a unique identifier for the payee for both on-us and off-us transactions.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.PayeeAccount.PayeeAccountNumber. The account number of the payee, which can be supplied as an IBAN. NOTE: This field's intended content is identical to payeeDataAccountNumber.

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.Transfer.Amount. The transaction amount in the original currency as indicated by Original Currency Code. In Remote Banking and Commercial Banking, the Original Amount is the amount as entered / requested by the customer. For example, if the customer inputs their payment as 40 EUR, this field holds 40, the Original Currency Code field holds EUR and the Normalized Original Amount holds the equivalent of 40 EUR in the system's normalized currency (for example, 54.92 for U.S.-based banks which use USD as the system's normalized currency)

From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionKey. A unique identifier for the transaction. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information. NOTE: It is not mandatory to supply Transaction Keys but it is recommended to do so for implementations which use policy rules to trigger actions on transactions such as challenge, step-up, delay or block. Providing a Transaction Key enables the solution to include the client's unique identifier for the transaction in the scoring response along with triggered policy actions.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionLocalDateTime. The local date and time of the transaction. When receiving transaction version, this field holds the local time and date of the current version. The value supplied should be the date and time when the party or user performed the transaction or, for a system generated transaction, when the transaction originated at the source system. The value must be represented in the local time zone where the transaction was originated. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.

When the transaction versioning feature is used, the value of this field is constant for all versions of the same transaction.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionSendinSystemCd. A code representing the system/application that is the integration point, or the system/application that is sending the transaction to the Actimize service for scoring. This field is primarily relevant in implementations in which there is more than one integration point; often such implementations make use of the transaction versioning feature. Refer to this field in the Actimize Fraud IFM interfaces Excel for more information and detailed examples.
From AZN_Mappings spreadsheet: Transaction.TransactionType. The client transaction type code. When this includes a service activity, such as an address or password change or a non-monetary servicing action (such as, Card Issue), additional detail on the transaction type should be provided in the servicesTransactionTypeCd field.
